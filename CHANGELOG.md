## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Initial scaffold of the Dashboards module.
- `PhoenixKit.Module` integration: auto-discovery, admin tab, permission,
  enable/disable.
- Backing `phoenix_kit_dashboards` table added as core PhoenixKit migration V133
  (modules do no DDL of their own).
- Widget provider contract — any module exposes widgets via a plain-map
  `phoenix_kit_widgets/0` (`PhoenixKitDashboards.Widget`).
- `PhoenixKitDashboards.Registry` — runtime discovery and a cached widget
  catalog (built-ins ∪ providers), filtered by module enablement and permissions.
- Built-in widgets: Note, Clock, Module stats.
- `phoenix_kit_dashboards` table + schema + context, with personal and
  system/shared dashboard scopes and a JSONB `layout` of widget instances.
- Manage page (`DashboardsLive`) and a gridstack-style 2D grid builder
  (`BuilderLive`) with add/remove, drag/resize persistence, and a
  schema-generated per-widget settings form.
